Codecademy Jamming app project 

First app built with React

After the first stage of project you are enouraged to add additional features yourself. 

Theres a checklist of features I have added or intended to add, but after showing somebody my progress, they mentioned that 
the way I was building with classes isn't the go to method anymore.

So i am moving on with the course and may re-visit upon level up.
